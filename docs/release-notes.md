## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-25

### üöÄ Highlights

#### Performance Improvements

This release delivers **dramatic performance improvements** across the board:

- **25-35% faster** overall request/response cycle
- **50-70% faster** header operations
- **40-60% fewer** memory allocations in request building
- **30-40% faster** method dispatch

All performance targets met or exceeded! See [BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md](docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md) for details.

#### Quality & Testing

- **189 comprehensive tests** covering all modules
- **85% code coverage** with unit tests
- Integration tests with live HTTP endpoints
- Property-based tests for conversion correctness
- Zero compiler warnings
- All tests passing

#### Modern Architecture

- **Binary-first design**: Maximum BEAM performance
- **Single-pass algorithms**: Eliminate redundant operations
- **Direct map construction**: Minimal allocations
- **Fluent builder pattern**: Clean, readable code
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function documented

### üì¶ What's New

#### Core Improvements

##### 1. Binary-First Design

Everything uses binaries by default for optimal performance:

```lfe
;; Methods are binaries
(http.request:new #"GET" "http://example.com")

;; Headers use binary keys and values
(http.header:add headers #"Content-Type" #"application/json")
```

##### 2. Fluent Builder Pattern

Chain operations for clean, readable code:

```lfe
(let* ((req1 (http.request:new #"POST" "http://api.example.com"))
       (req2 (http.request:set-header req1 #"Authorization" #"Bearer token"))
       (req3 (http.request:set-json req2 data)))
  (http.c:request req3))
```

##### 3. Smart Headers

Case-insensitive lookups with optimized storage:

```lfe
;; Works regardless of case
(http.header:get headers #"content-type" 'undefined #m(case-insensitive true))
(http.header:get headers #"Content-Type" 'undefined #m(case-insensitive true))
(http.header:get headers #"CONTENT-TYPE" 'undefined #m(case-insensitive true))
```

##### 4. Content-Type Helpers

Convenient functions for common formats:

```lfe
(http.request:set-json req data)       ; JSON with Content-Type
(http.request:set-form req form-data)   ; Form-encoded
(http.request:set-text req text)        ; Plain text
```

##### 5. Response Shortcuts

Quick builders for common status codes:

```lfe
(http.response:ok #"Success!")                    ; 200 OK
(http.response:created #"Resource created")       ; 201 Created
(http.response:not-found #"Not found")            ; 404 Not Found
(http.response:json 200 #"{\"status\":\"ok\"}")  ; JSON response
```

#### New Modules & Features

- **http.util**: Comprehensive utility functions for binary operations, conversions, and measurements
- **http.header**: Complete header management with case-insensitive operations
- **http.request**: Full request builder with query parameter support
- **http.response**: Response builder with convenience functions
- **http.c**: Optimized Erlang httpc interoperability
- **http.status**: 150+ HTTP status codes
- **http.mimetype**: 2000+ MIME type mappings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

This is a major version release with breaking changes. Migration is straightforward but required.

#### 1. Methods Now Use Binaries

**Before (v0.5.x):**

```lfe
(http.request:new 'get "http://example.com")
```

**After (v1.0.0):**

```lfe
(http.request:new #"GET" "http://example.com")
;; or let it convert for you
(http.request:new "get" "http://example.com")
(http.request:new 'get "http://example.com")
```

#### 2. Header Keys Are Lowercase Binaries

Headers are normalized to lowercase binaries for efficient storage. Use case-insensitive lookups to be safe:

```lfe
(http.header:get headers #"Content-Type" 'undefined #m(case-insensitive true))
```

#### 3. Request/Response Structure Changes

Requests now include parsed fields like `path-segments` and `query-parsed`. Use getter functions for forward compatibility:

```lfe
;; Preferred
(http.request:method req)
(http.request:headers req)
(http.request:query-params req)

;; Also works but not future-proof
(mref req 'method)
```
